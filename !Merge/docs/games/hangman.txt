Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The word is represented by underscores, and incorrect guesses result in drawing parts of a stick figure being "hanged." The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the figure is fully drawn, indicating a loss.
In this NVGT game, hangman works semilarly as above described. You have a list with your guessed letters, an input box with star signs which will be replaced through letters once you have guessed one, an actual input box to guess the letter you want to guess itself, and two buttons to close and guess your letter respectively. The navigation is quite self-explainatory, and you have a total of fifteen tries before the game ends. If you have guessed a letter correctly, your guesses will not be less.
Sometimes, words may take much effort to be guessed, and sometimes they are just two letter-combinations. We have a total of 120 words in our database, therefore for a while you should be able to enjoy it! It is not time based.
Good luck!
