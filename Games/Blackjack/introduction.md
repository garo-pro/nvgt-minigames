# Blackjack

Blackjack, in its simplified version, exclusively involves numbered cards from 1 to 10, excluding face cards and suits. The goal remains the same: achieve a total card value of 21 without surpassing it. Players start with two cards and decide whether to 'hit' for more cards or 'stand' to maintain their current total. numbered cards retain their face value. Strategy and calculated decisions drive this streamlined iteration of the classic game, focusing solely on numbers in pursuit of the winning hand.

This game is developed in NVGT.
