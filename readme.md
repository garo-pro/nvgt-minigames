## NVGT Minigames
Welcome to NVGT Minigames, an ever-growing collection of small timewaster games created using the [Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit](https://github.com/samtupy/nvgt). Eventually, we hope to have games in all different categories, from math games, to puzzle games, to word games, and many more.
Additionally, this collection is open sourced, which means that anyone who wants to add a new game or fix errors in the project can do so, and anyone who wants to learn how any of the games work can look at their source code freely.
## Launcher
It took three contributors to complete this project to a nearby finished and useable one. However, now I won'T talk around it after all, and directly feature it's functions and how to use it.
- The program loads a main menu, and can show debug logs if needed.
- The program is a central point to view documentations about the different mini games, and directly launch them within the launcher.
To run it, just run the file "launcher.nvgt" or "launcher.exe". The main menu should launch in less than one second.
## Documentation
To view the documentation, you can either read it in your text editor of choice, or you can view the documentation from the documentation viewer in the root directory.
