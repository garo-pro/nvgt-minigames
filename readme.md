## NVGT Mini Games
### What is NVGT Mini Games?
#### Let's split it up:
- [NVGT](https://nvgt.gg/) is in short a game engine similar to bgt developed by [Sam Tupy](https://samtupy.com/) on [git hub](https://github.com/samtupy/nvgt/) with lots of features. It allows it for users to create audio games or simple programs.
- Mini means or is another word for: Small, tiny.
- Games are things you can play, wether it is offline or online or in real life, that should be clear at all.

Together these form the words NVGT Mini Games. So these are a complilation of small and tiny games you can play offline. 

### The power
#### The power of open source:
This mini game collection is open source, allows it everyone to contribute, read and understand the code by it's source.

#### A strong in-build documentation:
The documentation can be accessed in two ways:
- Using the program's strong UI and access the documentation with the read only editor over the main menu.
- Viewing it in the documents folder itself, with an editor up to your choose.
Either way it is strong, well-organiced and easy to understand!


### The process of building
Note: If you simply want to run it, you only need step 2.
#### 1. [NVGT](https://nvgt.gg/downloads/)
First you need to download NVGT from the above link.
##### Version notes:
- 0.85.0: This is not useable unless you want to modify the code a little.
- 0.85.1: Useable
- 0.86.0: Useable, recommended.

After you'Ve done it, you can compile the script:
- Go to the context menu when you'Ve selected the main script.
- Select the sub menu compile.
- Press enter on release.
Success! You'Ve compiled the game by your own! There's still to do, though.

#### 2. [aria2c](https://github.com/aria/aria2/releases/)
You need to download the latest release of aria2c in order the game is able to download things which may come up in future.

That was all! You've built it!
