# Todo:
This is going to be a list with all things which still need to be done.

- Integrate GitHub actions so automated builds and releases could be generated.
- Adding the following minigames: Hangman, Simon says, Trivia, math, reaction time test
- Creating build scripts as alternative or co-solution for Github actions.
